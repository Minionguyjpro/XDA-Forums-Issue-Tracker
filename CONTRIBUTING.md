# Contribution
Hey there! If you read and used one of my guides and found an issue, you can report it here. Be sure to report it as an issue and **include the label**. Use the bug report template to create a correct issue.
## Bugs/problems
You can report any type of issues here from my XDA Forums guides. I have some guides about root, where you can report problems from the thread and issues when using the rooted device.
### Solvable problems
If you have problems that are able to be fixed, you can add the steps to fix it to your guide. To confirm this issue, I will try to reproduce the issue on my own device. When I've successfully reproduced it, I will add this issue to the list on the XDA thread and add the steps to fix it.
### Unsolvable problems
If you have problems that aren't able to be fixed, you must mention this in your issue. To confirm this issue, I will try to reproduce the issue on my own device. When I've successfully reproduced it, I will add this issue to the list on the XDA thread.
